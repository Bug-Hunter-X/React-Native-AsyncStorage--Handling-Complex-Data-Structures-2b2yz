In React Native, an uncommon error arises when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve complex data structures like objects or arrays.  The AsyncStorage API only accepts strings. If you try to directly store an object, you'll get an error or unexpected behavior.  The issue is often subtle, leading to silent failures where data isn't retrieved correctly or is corrupted.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
AsyncStorage.setItem('myData', { name: 'John', age: 30 }); // Error!
```
